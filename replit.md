## Auth Flow

- Signup uses Supabase `signUp` with email, password, full name, and role metadata.
- Email confirmation lands on `/auth/callback`, exchanges Supabase auth codes for a session, upserts the profile, and routes by role.
- Login uses Supabase email/password as the primary flow, with magic-link fallback still available.
- Role and display name are persisted locally as a fallback for callback routing and dashboard personalization.
- Supabase environment variables should be set in production as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

## Services (9 slugs)

| Slug | Label |
|------|-------|
| `employment-of-record` | Employment of Record |
| `secondment-services` | Secondment Services |
| `expatriate-services` | Expatriate Services |
| `hr-consultancy` | HR Consultancy |
| `payroll-tax` | Payroll & Tax Administration |
| `psychometric-assessments` | Psychometric Assessments |
| `recruitment-services` | Recruitment Services |
| `staff-outsourcing` | Staff Outsourcing |
| `interim-management` | Interim Management |

## Global Components

- `BackToTop` — `/src/components/ui/BackToTop.tsx`
- `ChatSupport` — `/src/components/ui/ChatSupport.tsx`
- Both mounted in `App.tsx` outside the router, always visible

## Navbar

- Top bar with social links + contact info + "Become a Member"
- Main nav with Services dropdown (9 services), About, Find Jobs, Contact
- User avatar dropdown with Dashboard, Profile, Logout when signed in
- Mobile hamburger menu
- Employer sidebar navigation uses Dashboard, Jobs, Candidates, Messages

## DB Schema Notes

- Supabase `profiles` table should include `id`, `role`, `full_name`, profile/contact fields, company fields, `preferences`, `onboarding_completed_at`, and `updated_at`.
- API server still contains legacy local auth/database code; the active frontend authentication path is Supabase.

## Stripe Integration

Stripe was NOT connected via Replit integration. To enable payments:
1. Connect Stripe integration in Replit
2. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
3. Update payment routes in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/payments.ts`
